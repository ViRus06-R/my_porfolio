          Hello! I'm a passionate full-stack developer with a love for creating
          elegant, efficient, and user-friendly web applications. With experience
          in both front-end and back-end technologies, I enjoy tackling complex
          problems and turning ideas into reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies,
          contributing to open-source projects, or enjoying a good book on software
          design patterns.
